🔍 Abstract
This project introduces a biometric-based attendance system using fingerprint sensors to replace traditional manual methods. The system ensures secure, accurate, and time-saving attendance recording by leveraging the uniqueness and reliability of biometric data. It eliminates issues such as proxy attendance and data loss while streamlining attendance collection and storage.

🚀 Problem Statement
Manual attendance using registers is inefficient, prone to human error, and susceptible to loss or damage. Existing systems often involve manual data entry or require expensive equipment for facial recognition, which is not always accurate or feasible.

✅ Proposed Solution
A cost-effective, automated attendance system using:

ESP32 microcontroller

R307 fingerprint sensor

OLED display

XAMPP server with PHPMyAdmin for backend data storage

When a student scans their fingerprint, the system:

Verifies identity

Records attendance instantly to a central database

Allows data export in Excel format for administrative use

🛠️ Tech Stack
🔧 Hardware
ESP32 Development Board

R307 Fingerprint Module

SSD1306 128x64 OLED Display

Perfboard, Connectors, Power Supply

💻 Software
Arduino IDE

XAMPP Server

PHP, HTML/CSS

Excel Integration via phpMyAdmin

📋 Features
Biometric fingerprint enrollment and verification

Real-time attendance logging

Web interface to view/export records

Excel sheet download support

Secure and centralized data storage

Reduced manual effort and human error

📌 Limitations & Future Scope
Biometric scanning may fail due to injuries or sensor issues

Concerns around data privacy need to be addressed

Potential to add:

SMS alerts for absentees

Multi-classroom integration

Cloud-based data storage

✅ Conclusion
This system demonstrates a reliable, secure, and efficient method of managing student attendance through biometrics. It minimizes manual workload and modernizes the attendance process for educational institutions.
